We have several types of particles here: Radioactive atoms (green) which can decay into spent atoms (red) and neutrons (grey), as well as control rods (black) that simply absorb neutrons.

Radioactive atoms can either decay on their own (every atom has a random chance of 1/1000 per frame to decay on its own) or they can be forced to decay by being struck by a neutron. This means that in low-density areas, atoms will mostly decay on their own as it's unlikely they will be struck by a neutron. In high-density areas, the amount of neutrons released and the small space between atoms makes it so that it's far more likely for an atom to be forced to decay from being struck. 

We can see how the density of atoms as well as the ratio of atoms to control rods can change the type of reaction from a natural decay to controlled burn all the way to being effectively an atom bomb.

There is no clearly defined critical mass here. Even with a low density we expect the atoms to decay rather quickly, and the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled chain reaction is no more than the speed be define to be controllable.
